Minor fixes from week 2 submission:
- Cards svg icons color changes
- Lines next to orange headings
- About Us section stats solid orange border added
- Forms alignment fixed


JavaScript Functionality
- SVG Icon Toggle: This uses event listeners for mouseenter and mouseleave to switch between two images within the .card elements. Includes learning of DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Form Submission: Using preventDefault to stop the form from submitting normally (stops page from refreshing). Submitted form data logged on console.
- Testimonials Slider: This handles user interactions like hovering or clicking, and shows different testimonials dynamically.
- Menu Toggle: Using event listeners and query selectors, this structure allows user to switch between breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus.
